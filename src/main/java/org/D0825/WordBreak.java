        In our specific problem, backtracking with memoization effectively acts like a top-down dynamic programming solution.
         The memoization step transforms what would be an exponential time complexity recursive solution into
         a polynomial one by storing intermediate results, similar to how a DP table would in a classical DP solution.

        Summary: While backtracking with memoization isnâ€™t exactly traditional DP,
        it is closely related. By memoizing recursive calls, it becomes a form of dynamic programming,
        especially when solving problems with overlapping subproblems and an optimal substructure, as seen here.
